          ðŸ“– What does P0D mean?
          P stands for "Period" (from the ISO 8601 standard). 0D indicates that the period has zero days.
           Since the values for years and months are also zero, the format simplifies to only the days.
            For example, if you created a Period.of(1, 2, 3), it would print: P1Y2M3D â€” 1 year, 2 months, and 3 days.
