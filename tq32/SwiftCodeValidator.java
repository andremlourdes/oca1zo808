/*
To extract the country code (the 5th and 6th characters) from a SWIFT code stored in a variable swiftCode,
you should use a method that retrieves this specific substring.
The substring(int startIndex, int endIndex) method returns the characters between the specified indices:
swiftCode.substring(4, 6) starts at index 4 (keeping in mind that the index starts at 0)It goes up to,
 but does not include, index 6Thus, it extracts the 5th and 6th characters â€” which correspond to the country code in the SWIFT format.
