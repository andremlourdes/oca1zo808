ðŸ§  What does the code do?
The code defines a class Test with a main method that calls another method called m1.
The m1 method prints a message to the console.

        m1 is a private static method that declares it can throw an exception (throws Exception).But in practice,
         it does not throw any exception, it just prints "NOT THROWING ANY EXCEPTION".
         ðŸ¤” Why use throws Exception if no exception is thrown? Great question!It may be for precaution,
         in case the method later includes operations that could throw exceptions (for example, file reading,
          networking, etc.).It could also be an educational example to show how exception declarations work.
          âœ… What happens when the code runs? The message "NOT THROWING ANY EXCEPTION"
          appears on the console.No exceptions are thrown, so the program ends normally.
