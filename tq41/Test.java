/*
What is happening here?str1 is created with the value "Core".str2 is created with the value "CoRe".
The line System.out.println(str1 = str2); is not comparing the values. It is assigning str2 to str1.
ðŸ§  Important detailsThe operator = is for assignment, not for comparison.After this line,
str1 starts to reference the same object as str2, that is, "CoRe".The println method prints the value of str1, which is now "CoRe".
